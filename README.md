# The challenge

### Context

Before an event occurs, an event organiser needs to have a list of all the participants who are taking part in their event and which race they are running in . This list is called a ‘race startlist’.

When someone makes a booking through our site, we need to collect all their relevant information and display it to our event organisers in a clear, easy to read format. 

### The data

We have created an API that returns an array of json objects that replicates our booking data. Each object holds key information about the booking, some or all of which may be useful information to include on an organiser’s race startlist

The data can be found [here](https://ldt-tech-test.herokuapp.com/api/startlistentries). To use the data provided in your application, you may either: 

1. Query the endpoint provided (i.e. a simple GET request)
2. Copy and paste the data into a file (within your application)

It does not matter which option you choose.

### Specification

You have been asked to build a dashboard that makes it easy for for organisers to view race startlist entries and ticket sale revenue.

1. It must be possible for organisers to apply a filter so that they can see only their startlist entries.
2. It must also be possible for each organiser to see how much they have made in ticket sales.

If you have time, you have also been given the opportunity to build in one other feature you think will be useful for our event organisers. As an engineer at Let’s Do This, you are heavily involved in all parts of a product’s development, so in addition to testing your coding ability, we also want to see how you think about engineering in the context of a broader product. Hence, we’re giving you some space to build something you think might be useful.

Some questions that might be helpful to consider:

- What do other products in this space usually do?
- How much time will your proposed features likely take you to implement? Do you have enough time? If not, is there a simpler way to give a user 80% of the experience?
